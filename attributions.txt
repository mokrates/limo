Attributions for code-snippets in limo
--------------------------------------

As the core is more or less my own, the more the language is capable
of, more and more I steal code to make limo even more useful (you
might think "yeah, sure", but, yeah, I really use it... a bit.)

It is usually required to give credit if one steals foreign code, but
even if it weren't, it is common courtesy to do so. So this here is
where the credit is to be given.
