specials:

_up		: the lexical upper environment. only valid in functions or macros

(try TRY CATCH)	: the TRY form is tried. if an error occurs, the CATCH form will be executed
     	 	  In the CATCH form, there is a var _EXCEPTION which contains the
		  argument to throw().

_exception	: see try

_callerenv	: the environment of the caller. not neccessarily equal to _up
		  only valid in macros. (used by quasiquote())

(eval EXP [ENV]): evaluate EXP under environment ENV. EXP and ENV are evaluated once under the
      	  	  normal environment, as befits a function. THEN EXP is evaluated again.

_env		: no real variable. has no entry in the environment.
		  the internal lookup-function returns the local environment to this name.

dcons/#<eagain>	: #<eagain> are instances of a type which cannot be instatiated by a program.
	  	  what CAN be instantiated are dcons'es.
		  #<eagain> is a type used to implement tailcall-optimization. if an EXP is the
		  last in an eval-chain, it is not evaluated, but packed into an #<eagain>
		  (evaluate again) and returned. this is purely internal.
		  it can be used with dcons(). dcons is a builtin, which evaluates it's first
		  argument, packs the second into an #<eagain> and cons'es those two.
		  this way the cdr of the cons only gets evaluated, when cdr() is called on the
		  cons. this is limo's way of implementing iterators.
